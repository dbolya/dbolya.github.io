We introduce Scalable Diverse Model Selection, a model selection task and benchmark suite for selecting the best pretrained model from the web to transfer to your data. This task is significantly more difficult than previous model selection tasks because we place no restrictions on the source models. We also introduce our own method, PARC, to go alongside the benchmark.
