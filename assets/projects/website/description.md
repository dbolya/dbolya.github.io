In case you were wondering, I made this website using [Svelt](https://svelte.dev/) as the framework and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for styling.
I think it came out quite well, and Svelte was very easy to use.
I was originally going to use React and Gatsby since this site is pretty static, but after realizing the hello world example for Gatsby is over 200 MB, I decided that maybe that was a little too heavy to use for this small website.
Then I chose Svelte instead because it looked easier to get started with and the hello world example was only 14 MB, so that means it has to be good, right?
Well, yeah it's pretty good. 10/10 would recommend Svelte.
