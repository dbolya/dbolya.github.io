			"description": "A handwritten math problem solver using our own OCR system and a lot of neural networks. It supports stacked operations, all arithmetic operations, and long division. It uses a 5 step pipeline to segment out the problems (using contours), classify the problem type (using CNNs), identify key operands (using CNNs), parse those operands (contours and CNNs), and finally solve the problem (using a math expression library). This won several awards for CS at the Sacramento STEM Fair and we presented it as finalists at ISEF 2016.",
